# Quick Share
## Project Description
### Introduction
In today’s interconnected world, sharing files across devices often involves exposing personal information through traditional methods like email or cloud storage, which can compromise user privacy. 
Quick Share addresses this issue by providing a platform for secure, anonymous, and fast file sharing, especially beneficial for users who prioritize privacy, such as activists, journalists, or professionals in sensitive industries.
Quick Share enables users to create and join rooms using only a display name and a randomly generated room code, avoiding the need for registration or sharing personal data. 
Its user-friendly interface ensures seamless real-time messaging and file transfers, enhancing both personal and professional communication.


### Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a platform that offers secure, anonymous, and rapid file sharing without requiring personal information or lengthy registration processes. Quick Share aims to:
•	Facilitate private and secure communication through a randomly generated room code.
•	Offer a simple and efficient user experience for quick, real-time file sharing and messaging.
•	Enhance privacy protection in file-sharing scenarios, making it an ideal solution for users in sensitive environments.
